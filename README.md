# Molina's .files

## Installing

- Use the stow command to create symlinks from the dotfiles to your home directory:
  - For a single application: `stow application_name`
  - For multiple applications: `stow app1 app2 app3`
  - For all applications: `stow */`

This will create symlinks from the dotfiles in ~/.dotfiles/application_name/ to ~/ while preserving the directory structure.
